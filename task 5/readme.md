# 🚢 Titanic Survival Data Analysis

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic Titanic dataset using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to uncover hidden patterns and relationships that influenced passenger survival.


## 📁 Files Included

- `titanic_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full code, visualizations, and analysis
- `Titanic pdf.pdf` – PDF version of the analysis report
- `train.csv` – Training data used for EDA
  

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`


## 📊 Key Features

- Descriptive statistics using `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`
- Univariate analysis with histograms and count plots
- Bivariate analysis with boxplots, scatterplots, and heatmaps
- Multivariate analysis using pairplots and correlation matrix
- Clear visualizations and markdown-based observations
- Summary of findings and conclusion


## 📌 Summary of Insights

- Females had a significantly higher chance of survival
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive
- Higher fare generally indicated better survival odds
- Younger passengers had a slight edge in survival


## 📚 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `titanic_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab
